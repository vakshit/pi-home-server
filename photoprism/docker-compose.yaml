# Example Docker Compose config file for PhotoPrism (Raspberry Pi 3/4 and other ARM64-based devices)
#
# Note:
# - You have to boot your Raspberry Pi 3/4 with the parameter "arm_64bit=1" in config.txt to use our ARM64 (64-bit) image.
#   An "exec format" error will occur otherwise.
# - Try explicitly pulling the ARM64 version if you've booted your device with the "arm_64bit=1" flag and you see
#   the "no matching manifest" error on Raspberry Pi OS (Raspbian). See documentation for details.
# - Use https://dl.photoprism.app/docker/armv7/docker-compose.yml to run PhotoPrism and MariaDB on ARMv7-based devices
#   as well as Raspberry Pi OS (Raspbian) installations without 64-bit support.
# - Running PhotoPrism on a server with less than 4 GB of swap space or setting a memory/swap limit can cause unexpected
#   restarts ("crashes"), for example, when the indexer temporarily needs more memory to process large files.
# - In case you see Docker errors related to "cgroups", try adding the following parameters to /boot/firmware/cmdline.txt
#   or /boot/cmdline.txt (file location depends on the OS in use): cgroup_enable=cpuset cgroup_enable=memory cgroup_memory=1
# - If you install PhotoPrism on a public server outside your home network, please always run it behind a secure
#   HTTPS reverse proxy such as Traefik or Caddy. Your files and passwords will otherwise be transmitted
#   in clear text and can be intercepted by anyone, including your provider, hackers, and governments:
